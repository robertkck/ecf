# Preface {-}

This website serves to illustrate the findings of the policy contribution "An approach to identify the sources of low-carbon growth for Europe" [@zachmann] and allows a deeper dive into the underlying data.  The website is focused on presenting figures and deliberately only offers curt descriptions/interpretations. It is currently structured into five chapters but we plan to extend it when further steps of our analysis become available.
